### Hi there 👋

- I am a postgraduate majored in software engineering in Shanghai and strive to be a 10x programmer.
- I have a wide range of interests including Web development💻, Unix programming and Cloud Native☁.
- I believe that computers' ability has not been fully exploited to augment human intellect. And I am currently working on my own digital brain based on Obsidian [here](https://github.com/luc99hen/Obsidian_Lucki).
