### Hi there 👋

- I am a software engineer in alibaba cloud and strive to be a better programmer.
- I have a wide range of interests including Cloud Native☁, Deep Learning🧠 and Web development💻.
- I believe that computers' ability has not been fully exploited to augment human intellect. And I am currently working on my own digital brain based on Obsidian.
